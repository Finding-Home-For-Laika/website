          <h2>About Jimena</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Jimena, and I started pet sitting last year here in
            Seattle. I’ve had the joy of caring for dogs and cats of all sizes
            and ages, and it has truly been a wonderful experience. Each pet I
            care for teaches me something new, and I’ve learned how essential it
            is to understand the unique needs and love every pet deserves.
            Through communication and honesty, I make sure both pets and owners
            receive the attention they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I work full-time remotely, I’m flexible in coordinating
            schedules that fit with pet owners’ needs. The love and trust I’ve
            received from my clients, both pets and humans, has been incredible,
            and it’s given me the chance to learn more about various breeds,
            energy levels, and special care requirements, including medical
            needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I’m especially passionate about senior pets, and to
            encourage <strong>#AdoptASeniorPet</strong>, I offer lower rates
            because they deserve the best life possible.
          </p>
